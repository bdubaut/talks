# CQRS/ES & Elixir

I gave this talk in September 2019 at the [Amsterdam Elixir Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-Elixir/) hosted by [Impraise](www.impraise.com). 

In this talk I give an introduction to the CQRS/ES architecture pattern and how to implement it in your application in Elixir with the [Commanded](https://commanded.io) framework.
